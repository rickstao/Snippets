This lab contains CommandLineArguments.c, FileIO.c, standardInput.c, hello.c, README, Makefile, and FileReverse.c

hello.c prints “hello” to the console.

CommandLineArguments.c takes in the command line arguments and prints it into the console

FileIO.c takes in the content of a file and prints it onto a new file.

standardInput.c reads three integers from stdin and prints them to stdout

FileReverse.c reverses the content in file in and prints onto file out.
